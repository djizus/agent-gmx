# Vega - Advanced AI Trading Agent

Vega is an autonomous AI-powered trading agent for GMX perpetual futures on Arbitrum/Avalanche networks. Built with the Daydreams AI framework, it implements sophisticated scalping strategies with advanced risk management and AI-driven market intelligence.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Trading Capabilities
- **Autonomous Trading**: AI-driven decision making with Claude Sonnet 4
- **Multi-Network Support**: Arbitrum and Avalanche GMX markets
- **Advanced Risk Management**: Comprehensive failsafe validations and position sizing
- **Intelligent Market Analysis**: Synth AI integration with multi-timeframe momentum analysis
- **Real-time Execution**: Sequential transaction queue with nonce management

### Enhanced Safety
- **Failsafe Validations**: Price direction validation for all take profit/stop loss orders
- **Error Prevention**: Pre-validation eliminates common trading mistakes
- **Dynamic Leverage Management**: Adjusts position sizes based on market volatility

### AI Intelligence
- **Synth AI Integration**: Decentralized AI miner predictions for BTC/ETH
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Short (15m-1h), Medium (1h-4h), Long (4h+) term signals
- **Dynamic Levels**: Prediction-based stops and targets (not arbitrary percentages)
- **Smart Setup Detection**: WAIT vs actionable signals with trade quality grading (A-D)
- **Momentum Confluence**: Aligns multiple timeframes for high-probability setups

### Performance Optimization
- **Advanced Caching System**: 5-minute TTL cache with promise deduplication prevents redundant API calls
- **Smart Data Loading**: Context-based data loading with cache-first architecture
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents concurrent duplicate API calls at cache level
- **Transaction Queue**: Sequential execution prevents nonce errors
- **Optimized Trading Cycles**: Event-driven architecture with intelligent triggers

## üß† AI Intelligence System

### Synth AI Integration
Vega leverages decentralized AI miners for market predictions:

### Smart Setup Detection
- **High Confidence + Aligned Timeframes** ‚Üí Actionable LONG/SHORT signals
- **Conflicting Signals or Low Confidence** ‚Üí WAIT recommendation
- **Trade Quality Grading** ‚Üí A (excellent) to D (poor) based on confluence

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Warning

**HIGH RISK - REAL MONEY TRADING**: This is a live trading system that uses real cryptocurrency. 

- Only use funds you can afford to lose completely
- Cryptocurrency trading involves significant financial risk
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- This software is for educational/research purposes
- Not financial advice - trade at your own risk
- Test with small amounts before deploying significant capital
- Monitor the agent continuously during operation

## üîß Development

### Testing
```bash
# No formal testing framework - relies on TypeScript strict mode
# Test manually with small amounts first
bun run agent-gmx.ts
```
